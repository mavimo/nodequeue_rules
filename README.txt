This module provides a basic rules integration for nodequeue.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

You need the following modules for a working feature:

 * Nodequeue (http://drupal.org/project/nodequeue)
 * Rules (http://drupal.org/project/rules)


-- INSTALLATION --

Copy the module files to you module directory and then enable it on the admin
modules page. After that you'll see new actions and events in the listing while
creating a new rule.


-- WARNING --

This module is in very alpha stage therefore don't complain if it doesn't work.
The very first section I needed to have working was "actions" one, conditions haven't been tested yet.
